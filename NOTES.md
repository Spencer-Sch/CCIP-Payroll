- added function isOwner returns bool, owner() func on ownable works but since we then needed to look for bool on front end thought that would simplify from end logic / routing
- think that the LogIn flow is a little better

Login.tsx
Web3 modal pops up when you hit login button - should only pop up if there is a contract address in the form

Now logOut if funky
Cant log in with Metamask

DeployForm
- just using useContractWrite was able to click button and make action got this error in browser console
    next-dev.js:20 ConnectorNotFoundError: Connector not found at writeContract (chunk-TSH6VVF4.js:2348:1)
